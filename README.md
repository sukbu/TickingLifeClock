# Life Battery Clock - Ticking Lifeclock

I've built this program on a random day in my unemployed period. Thought about managing time and how much time is remaining. By visibly seeing the remaining days in our life, probably we can plan and prospect what can be done within certain time segment. I'm opened to collaboration with other persons whoever interested in this program. I'm very lazy person so there a pile of unshared programs, I decided to gradually share the programs. Some people likely had similar thought like this program, but some of others might have not thought in this way. Somehow this program may be quite silly, but I hope others to have awareness of their time as well as others'. From Korea, 2025-11-29, in the middle of sunset.
